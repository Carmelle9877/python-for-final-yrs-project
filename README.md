This includes all the code I worte for my final year project on the Bifurcations of transition states
I recommend looking at the 'final-code' folder for my refined code that i used for the final results. (all this code should run)
The 'all-code' folder includes some previous attempts to solve the same problems which are less efficient/not as functional but may show more insight into how i think. (some of this code might not run)
The 'plots' folder shows the output from running the code with certain inputs and some of these were used in my final dissertation.
