The aim of my final year project was to identify trajectories on potential energy surfaces(PESs) to see how they changed based on small changes in initial conditions. This came down to identifying and plotting periodic orbits(POs) on PESs using python to model these surfaces and trajectories and to solve for the POs. I came into this project having practically no background in the area so you can see me break it down into smaller sections as I go. I began with making an effective way to plot different PESs, choosing to plot them in 2D and making changes to the number of contour lines as well as assing numbers to them to dignify their energy levels. I then learned how to add trajectories to these PESs and had to find what initial conditions of these trajectories formed POs. Once I had solved for some simple POs I began to plot them on more complicated PESs to see how they interacted at higher energy levels.

This includes all the code I wrote for my final year project on the Bifurcations of transition states.
I recommend looking at the 'final-code' folder for my refined code that i used for the final results. (all this code should run).
The 'all-code' folder includes some previous attempts to solve the same problems which are less efficient/not as functional but may show more insight into how I think. (some of this code might not run).
The 'plots' folder shows the output from running the code with certain inputs and some of these were used in my final dissertation.
